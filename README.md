General Algorithmic Code snippets
================================================

Welcome to my repository.
Trying to revive a long forgotten repository. This is a part of Hacktoberfest.

Your contributions are more than welcome.

My main objectives during this month (Hacktoberfest):
- Add more algorithms to this repo.
- Make code more readable and follow better coding practices. 
  I would recommend following C++ style guide https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html.
- Review and provide feedback on C++ coding style and practices. 


Guideline
====================
Keep the PR small, atomic and self contained for a smoother review.
